# Enterprise deployment using App Services Environment
Azure App Service is a PaaS service used to host a variety of apps on Azure: web apps, API apps, functions, and mobile apps. App Service Environment or ASE allows enterprises to deploy their App Service apps in a subnet in their own Azure Virtual Network, providing an isolated, highly scalable, and dedicated environment for their cloud workloads.
